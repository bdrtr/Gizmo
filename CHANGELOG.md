# Changelog

All notable changes to the Gizmo engine are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Versioning note.** `0.2.0` ships the whole workspace at one uniform `0.x`
> version on purpose: it bundles the large 1.0-readiness effort and the breaking
> graphics-stack upgrade, but **defers the hard `1.0` promise** to gain soak time
> on the new `wgpu`/`winit`/`egui` stack. The *staged* `1.0` model — promoting the
> dependency-light **Stage A** core (`gizmo-math`, `gizmo-core`, the
> `gizmo-physics-*` crates, `gizmo-scene`, `gizmo-net`, `gizmo-audio`, `gizmo-ai`)
> to `1.x` while the graphics/integration **Stage B** crates stay on `0.y` — is
> documented in [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) and remains the planned path for a
> later release.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-25

The first release since `0.1.7`. It gathers the entire 1.0-readiness effort
(audit + hardening rounds) and the graphics-stack upgrade, shipped as a single
breaking `0.x` bump. **Upgrading from `0.1.x`? See the
[migration guide](docs/migration-0.1-to-0.2.md).**

### Changed (breaking)

- **ECS query API split along the safe/unsafe boundary (closes a soundness hole).**
  `World::query::<Q>(&self)` previously accepted a *mutable* query (`Q = Mut<T>`)
  from a shared `&World`, so two live `Mut<T>` queries (or `Mut<T>` + `&T`) could
  alias the same storage — reachable from **safe code**, with no panic. The query
  surface is now:
  - `World::query::<Q: ReadOnlyQuery>(&self)` — **read-only** (`&T`, `With`/
    `Without`/`Changed`/`Added`, `Or`, and tuples of those).
  - `World::query_mut::<Q>(&mut self)` / `World::borrow_mut::<T>(&mut self)` —
    safe **mutable** access (requires `&mut World`).
  - `unsafe World::query_unchecked::<Q>(&self)` / `borrow_mut_unchecked::<T>` —
    escape hatch for code that only holds `&World` (e.g. inside the parallel
    scheduler's `System::run(&World)`), with a documented `# Safety` contract.

  Migrate by replacing `world.query::<Mut<T>>()` with `world.query_mut::<Mut<T>>()`
  (`borrow_mut` now needs `&mut World`); pure-read call sites are unchanged. On a
  `Query`, `iter`/`get`/`iter_chunks`/`par_for_each`/`entities`/`contains` are
  read-only; use `iter_mut`/`get_mut`/`iter_chunks_mut`/`par_for_each_mut` for
  mutation. Behavior is unchanged (determinism hash identical).
- **`RigidBody` lost its `friction` and `restitution` fields**, and
  `RigidBody::new` is now `new(mass, use_gravity)` (was
  `new(mass, restitution, friction, use_gravity)`). These fields were **dead**:
  the contact solver always sourced friction/restitution from the colliders'
  `PhysicsMaterial` (combined per contact), so setting them on the body did
  nothing — the editor inspector even exposed two no-op sliders. Configure
  contact friction/restitution on the collider material instead. Determinism is
  unchanged (proof the fields never affected the simulation). The scripting layer
  followed suit: the Lua `physics.add_rigidbody(id, mass, use_gravity)` binding
  and `ScriptCommand::AddRigidBody` dropped their (ignored) `restitution`/
  `friction` parameters.
- **Graphics stack upgraded** across the Stage B crates: `wgpu 0.20 → 29`,
  `winit 0.29 → 0.30`, `egui 0.28 → 0.34` (plus `egui-wgpu`/`egui-winit` `0.34`,
  `egui_dock 0.13 → 0.19`, `transform-gizmo-egui 0.3 → 0.9`). Public `wgpu`/
  `winit`/`egui` types in the renderer/window/editor/app/facade move to the new
  versions. See [`docs/graphics-upgrade-plan.md`](docs/graphics-upgrade-plan.md).
- **`bevy_reflect` is now gated behind an off-by-default `reflect` feature** on
  `gizmo-core`, `gizmo-physics-core`, `gizmo-physics-rigid`, and `gizmo-scene`.
  With default features, scene save/load + snapshots fall back to plain `serde`
  (every reflected component also derives `Serialize`/`Deserialize`), and
  `bevy_reflect` no longer appears in the default public API or — after the
  `gizmo-math` dependency-hygiene fix below — in the Stage A dependency tree.
- **`CollisionEvent.contact_points`** is now an opaque `ContactPoints` newtype
  (`gizmo_physics_core::collision::ContactPoints`) instead of leaking
  `arrayvec::ArrayVec`.
- **96+ public enums/structs marked `#[non_exhaustive]`** (error/shape/event
  enums and `Default`/constructor-guaranteed config structs) so future variants
  and fields are not breaking. Closed leaf math/config types are intentionally
  exempt.
- **Many constructors/loaders now return `Result`/`Option`** instead of
  panicking (`spawn_gltf`, `ComponentRegistry::register`, `SceneData::save/load*`,
  `AudioManager::new/play*`, `NetworkClient/Server::new`, `AppWindow::new`,
  `App::run`, renderer `load_*`, …), and 13 concrete error enums were added.
- **Infallible plain-value getters dropped the `get_` prefix** (`get_neighbors →
  neighbors`, `get_entity_component_types → entity_component_types`,
  `get_log_version → log_version`, `get_engine_torque → engine_torque`,
  `get_entity_names → entity_names`). Fallible `get_*` accessors that return
  `Option`/`Result` keep the prefix, following the Bevy convention.
- **MSRV raised to `1.92`** (floor set by `egui 0.34`), up from `1.89`. Enforced
  by a CI `msrv` job. Earlier in the cycle the MSRV was empirically set to `1.89`
  (1.82/1.85 fail on transitive `crypto-common`/`wide`/`safe_arch`).
- **`glam` is now re-exported directly** (`pub use glam::{…}` in `gizmo-math`)
  and documented as an official public dependency, rather than via `bevy_math`.

### Added

- **The engine now runs in the browser (WebGPU/WASM).** `gizmo-renderer`,
  `gizmo-app` and the facade build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with a web
  feature subset, using a reduced 4-bind-group forward pipeline (browser
  `maxBindGroups = 4`; shadows/deferred/compute disabled on wasm). The new
  `demo-web/` crate (wasm-bindgen + `index.html`) shows a live physics scene in
  the browser and was verified end-to-end in headless Chrome. `gizmo-app`'s wasm
  `resumed` implements the async WebGPU init via `spawn_local`; `gizmo-scripting`
  (mlua) is target-gated to native, and the CI `wasm` job now also builds the
  graphics stack. Audio/networking/scripting remain native-only (RELEASING §4g).
- Deterministic same-platform **rollback netcode** (`gizmo-net`, `rollback`
  feature): `PhysicsWorld::snapshot`/`restore_snapshot` (full internal state incl.
  contact warm-start), a `Transport` trait with real-UDP and loopback impls, and
  a GGPO-style `RollbackSession` that converges under lag + packet loss.
- `PhysicsWorld::state_hash()` sync-hash API (process-stable) for desync
  detection and replay, plus a cross-process determinism oracle.
- **TGS Soft constraint solver** (Box2D-v3-style) for stable tall/high-energy
  stacks, with dormant-pair narrow-phase skipping for wide settled scenes.
- Continuous collision detection (CCD) hardening (no tunnelling), full joint
  library behavioural coverage, island-aware sleeping, and a phase-timed
  `PhysicsMetrics` profiler.
- Property-based and differential test suites across ECS, collision, raycast,
  SAT, ABA/multibody, joints, soft-body, and fracture; a CI matrix
  (ubuntu/macos/windows), a ratcheted `clippy -D warnings` gate, and a headless
  determinism gate.
- `RELEASING.md` (staged-1.0 strategy) and this changelog.

### Fixed

- **`gizmo-math` dependency hygiene:** removed an unused regular `bevy_math`
  dependency that transitively pulled `bevy_reflect` into the Stage A *production*
  dependency tree even with the `reflect` feature off. `bevy_reflect` is now
  absent from the default Stage A tree.
- Numerous correctness fixes across the EPA/GJK contact pipeline, integrator
  (body-space inertia), split-impulse leakage, joint effective-mass, renderer
  mesh winding + skin-weight normalisation + skinned-normal inverse-transpose,
  and post-process depth linearisation (see git history for the per-round audit
  detail).
- **egui 0.34 / winit 0.30 deprecations migrated** off the crate-level
  `#![allow(deprecated)]` bridges left by the graphics upgrade: all mechanical
  egui renames, plus the top-level panel `show(ctx)` pattern migrated to egui
  0.34's root-`Ui` composition (`show_inside`). The only remaining (scoped,
  documented) deprecation is winit's closure `EventLoop::run`/`create_window`
  bridge in `gizmo-app`, whose `ApplicationHandler` migration is deferred.

## [0.1.7] — earlier
