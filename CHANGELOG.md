# Changelog

All notable changes to the Gizmo engine are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Versioning note.** `0.2.0` ships the whole workspace at one uniform `0.x`
> version on purpose: it bundles the large 1.0-readiness effort and the breaking
> graphics-stack upgrade, but **defers the hard `1.0` promise** to gain soak time
> on the new `wgpu`/`winit`/`egui` stack. The *staged* `1.0` model — promoting the
> dependency-light **Stage A** core (`gizmo-math`, `gizmo-core`, the
> `gizmo-physics-*` crates, `gizmo-scene`, `gizmo-net`, `gizmo-audio`, `gizmo-ai`)
> to `1.x` while the graphics/integration **Stage B** crates stay on `0.y` — is
> documented in [`docs/ENGINE.md`](docs/ENGINE.md) and remains the planned path for a
> later release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] — 2026-08-04

A correctness and honesty release. It carries no new features: it closes two paths to
undefined behaviour, one determinism hole, and the reason the facade only ever compiled
in a single configuration — all found by an external audit
([`docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md`](docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md)), and all with the evidence written
down rather than summarised.

**It is a minor bump rather than a patch because three public signatures changed.** Two
of them changed because their previous shape was the bug: a fracture API seeded from
thread-local entropy cannot be reproduced, and a `&self` method that mutates a Lua VM
cannot be `Sync`. Keeping the old signatures would have meant keeping the defects.

Upgrading from `0.8.0`:

- `generate_fracture_chunks(..)` takes a trailing `seed: u64`. Pass anything
  reproducible — an entity id, a frame counter — not `rand::random()`.
- `ScriptEngine::has_function` and `::run_entity_update` take `&mut self`. Callers
  reaching them through a `World` resource need `ResMut`, not `Res`.
- `gizmo_app::headless::App` and `gizmo_app::windowed::App` now coexist. `gizmo_app::App`
  still resolves to the windowed runtime when it is compiled in, so most code is
  unaffected; `headless::App::add_plugin` is unavailable when both are present.
- Several facade items are now behind the feature that actually provides them. A default
  build is unchanged; a `--no-default-features` build now compiles at all, which it
  previously did not.

### Fixed — soundness

- **`unsafe impl Sync for ScriptEngine` was unsound and published.** mlua's `send`
  feature makes `Lua` `Send`; it never makes it `Sync`, because the `lua_State` is
  mutated through `&Lua`. `has_function` and `run_entity_update` did exactly that
  behind `&self`, and `ScriptEngine` is stored as a `World` resource — so two
  systems holding a shared reference could race on the interpreter. Both methods
  now take `&mut self`, which makes concurrent VM access unrepresentable rather
  than merely discouraged. **Breaking** for direct callers; there were none outside
  the crate.
- **`World::query_entity_mut` skipped its aliasing check.** Every other query entry
  point runs `check_aliasing` first; this one did not, so
  `query_entity_mut::<(Mut<T>, Mut<T>)>(id)` was safe code that handed out two live
  `&mut T` to the same row — undefined behaviour with no panic and no compile error.
  It now panics like the other paths, as does `query_entity` for symmetry.

### Fixed — determinism

- **`generate_fracture_chunks` seeded itself from thread-local entropy**, so
  identical inputs produced different chunk geometry, masses and spins. Any scene
  that fractured diverged between replays and desynced under rollback. It now takes
  an explicit `seed: u64`. **Breaking**: the parameter is required, because keeping
  the old signature would mean keeping the bug. The ECS fracture path
  (`shatter_entity`) was already deterministic and is unaffected.

### Fixed — feature composition

- **`gizmo-engine` compiled in exactly one configuration.** Its own advertised
  `headless` feature failed with 37 errors, and `--no-default-features` plus every
  single-feature build failed too — so the README's headless-server story was dead
  code. The facade's modules are now gated on what they actually use.
- **`gizmo-physics-core` is now a mandatory dependency of the facade.** It defines
  `Transform`, `GlobalTransform` and `Collider`, so gating it behind `physics` also
  broke `--features render` and `--features audio`: nothing can be drawn or
  spatialised without a transform. `physics` now gates the *simulation*
  (`gizmo-physics-rigid`), which is the honest split.
- **`gizmo-app`'s `window` feature was non-additive** — enabling it *deleted*
  `headless::App`. Since Cargo unifies features across the whole graph, an unrelated
  dependency turning `window` on could silently swap a simulation server's `App`
  type out from under it. Both runtimes now coexist and are reachable by path; the
  root re-export still prefers the windowed one, so existing code is unaffected.
  `headless::App::add_plugin` is unavailable when both are compiled in, because
  `Plugin::build` is typed against the root `App`.
- A `feature-powerset` CI job (`cargo hack --depth 2`) now covers both entry crates.

### Added — supply chain and process

- `deny.toml` and a `cargo deny` CI job covering advisories, licences, sources and
  duplicate versions. Every exception carries a written justification. The first run
  fixed one advisory (`crossbeam-epoch` → 0.9.20) and documented five, including
  `bincode 1.x`, which is a direct dependency of `gizmo-net` and is tracked for
  migration.
- MPL-2.0 (via `rodio` → `symphonia`, on the default `audio` feature) is now
  disclosed explicitly rather than sitting unremarked under a flat "MIT OR
  Apache-2.0".
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md` — an external review with every finding pinned to
  `file:line` — and `docs/FIXPLAN.md`, which tracks the work it opened.

### Fixed — other

- The two golden-image GPU tests are serialised behind a mutex. Each requested its
  own wgpu device, and `cargo test` runs a binary's tests in parallel — concurrent
  device creation surfaced as an intermittent `SIGSEGV` inside the driver that took
  down the whole workspace run.
- `car_demo` and `wind_tunnel` loaded models from absolute paths into the original
  author's home directory and unwrapped the result, so the demo the README tells
  people to run panicked for everyone else. Optional assets now resolve through
  `demo::assets` and fall back to procedural geometry.
- README feature claims corrected: there is no Sweep-and-Prune broadphase (it is a
  dynamic AABB tree, and single-threaded), no `gizmo-physics` crate, no mimalloc in
  `gizmo-core`, and no Doppler in `gizmo-audio`. Determinism — the one property here
  with no equivalent in Rapier or Avian — is now stated, having previously gone
  unmentioned.

### Added

- **Ergonomics (DX).** `Prefab` — a define-once / spawn-many blueprint (mesh +
  material + optional `RigidBodyBundle`) with `spawn` / `spawn_at` /
  `spawn_with_mass` + per-instance `with_pbr`. `AutoBoxCollider` — derive a box
  collider from an entity's `Transform.scale` so the size is authored once
  (opt-in marker + a synchronous `Prefab` path). Auto-despawn lifetime
  components (`DespawnAfter` / `DespawnBelowY` + `LifetimePlugin`), `FpsLook`
  mouse-look camera controller, `World::despawn_all_with::<C>()` bulk despawn.
- **Tooling.** Broad unit-test sweep (~1376 tests across the workspace);
  structured `tracing` logging (instrument spans + fields) across the value
  crates, with silent error-swallows promoted to `warn!` / `error!`.

### Changed

- **Docs.** Consolidated 12 planning / fix-plan documents (roadmap, releasing,
  determinism, migration, architecture, and the finished FIX-PLANs) into a
  single [`docs/ENGINE.md`](docs/ENGINE.md); `README` / `CHANGELOG` /
  `demo-web/README` stay standalone.

### Fixed

- **Physics — resting-stack stability.** A settled box stack that spontaneously
  gained energy and blew up (lateral buckling) is fixed by a manifold **block
  solver** (coplanar normals solved jointly + Tikhonov regularization) plus
  **full warm-start** (`warm_start_factor` 0.85 → 1.0) — stable to N≤32 (was
  ~N≤16); N≥48 towers remain open. See [`docs/ENGINE.md`](docs/ENGINE.md) §7.
- **Rendering — 6 latent bugs.** World tangent (plain model 3×3, not
  inverse-transpose); PBR param-packing overflow at 1.0; ECS query
  `get` / `contains` now honour table-storage `With` / `Without` filters
  (matched `iter`); shadow-caster instance ordering (two-region layout); glTF
  `AlphaMode::Mask` cutout (alpha-cutoff discard).
- **Physics — perf.** Quadratic costs removed (broadphase pair dedup
  O(P²)→O(P); per-island TGS scratch sized to the island; per-contact constants
  hoisted out of the sweep loop): worst frame 262→46 ms on a 2000-box scene.
- **App — GPU robustness.** Surface `Outdated` / `Lost` now reconfigures the
  swapchain and backs off (rate-limited) instead of freezing or busy-spinning;
  `CloseRequested` shuts down gracefully (runs `Drop` → clean wgpu teardown)
  instead of `process::exit(0)`.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-12

A large feature release gathering ~205 commits since `0.2.0`. The whole
workspace continues to ship at one uniform `0.x` version (the staged `1.0`
model in [`docs/ENGINE.md`](docs/ENGINE.md) remains the planned later path). No
crate-level API is promised stable yet; treat any change as potentially
breaking and pin an exact `=0.8.0` if you need reproducibility.

### Added

- **Physics — joints.** First-class `Distance`/`Rope` joint; a generic 6-DoF
  (`D6`) joint with per-axis motors + springs; cone-twist, slider suspension,
  and hinge torsional-spring joints; per-joint compliance, asymmetric cone
  limits, distance reachability, spring-break, and servo motors.
- **Physics — bodies & vehicles.** Consolidated vehicle simulation in
  `gizmo-physics-dynamics` (dynamics is now canonical; the dead rigid vehicle
  path was removed); ECS systems for vehicle/character + ragdoll runtime;
  opt-in aerodynamic drag (½ρCdAv²) for rigid bodies; CCD exposed via bundle
  builders with analytic test ladders; `RigidBodyBundle` derives rotational
  inertia from its collider.
- **Physics — soft bodies & water.** Hardened cloth ↔ rigid-body collision
  (capsule, per-segment edge, averaged push) plus cloth tearing; a Subnautica-
  style water system (`water_at` query, swimming controller, Gerstner waves,
  underwater camera fog) and character oxygen.
- **Physics — ergonomics.** Fluent builders for materials, colliders, bodies
  and bundles; `PhysicsPlugin` auto-steps at the app's fixed timestep;
  `GameplayPhysicsPlugin` registers vehicle/character systems.
- **Rendering.** Textured PBR (normal / metallic-roughness / emissive / AO
  maps); distance-based texture streaming wired end-to-end; AAA smoke VFX
  (soft particles, flipbook, curl-noise, lit) with volumetric ray-marched
  smoke; headless/offscreen renderer (no window/surface); HighPerformance GPU
  adapter preference.
- **Web / WASM.** The deterministic simulation core compiles to `wasm32`, and
  the full engine runs in the browser (WebGPU/WASM) with an audio backend and
  a hardened web surface.
- **Animation & glTF.** Two-bone IK + FABRIK, cubic-Hermite scale tracks;
  `KHR_texture_transform`, `KHR_materials_emissive_strength`, and glTF sampler
  settings honoured.
- **Camera.** Orthographic projection mode (Numpad5 toggle) and
  `screen_to_ray` screen→world picking.
- **CI.** Run-once benchmark gate (and the engine bug it caught).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-25

The first release since `0.1.7`. It gathers the entire 1.0-readiness effort
(audit + hardening rounds) and the graphics-stack upgrade, shipped as a single
breaking `0.x` bump. **Upgrading from `0.1.x`? See the
[migration guide](docs/ENGINE.md).**

### Changed (breaking)

- **ECS query API split along the safe/unsafe boundary (closes a soundness hole).**
  `World::query::<Q>(&self)` previously accepted a *mutable* query (`Q = Mut<T>`)
  from a shared `&World`, so two live `Mut<T>` queries (or `Mut<T>` + `&T`) could
  alias the same storage — reachable from **safe code**, with no panic. The query
  surface is now:
  - `World::query::<Q: ReadOnlyQuery>(&self)` — **read-only** (`&T`, `With`/
    `Without`/`Changed`/`Added`, `Or`, and tuples of those).
  - `World::query_mut::<Q>(&mut self)` / `World::borrow_mut::<T>(&mut self)` —
    safe **mutable** access (requires `&mut World`).
  - `unsafe World::query_unchecked::<Q>(&self)` / `borrow_mut_unchecked::<T>` —
    escape hatch for code that only holds `&World` (e.g. inside the parallel
    scheduler's `System::run(&World)`), with a documented `# Safety` contract.

  Migrate by replacing `world.query::<Mut<T>>()` with `world.query_mut::<Mut<T>>()`
  (`borrow_mut` now needs `&mut World`); pure-read call sites are unchanged. On a
  `Query`, `iter`/`get`/`iter_chunks`/`par_for_each`/`entities`/`contains` are
  read-only; use `iter_mut`/`get_mut`/`iter_chunks_mut`/`par_for_each_mut` for
  mutation. Behavior is unchanged (determinism hash identical).
- **`RigidBody` lost its `friction` and `restitution` fields**, and
  `RigidBody::new` is now `new(mass, use_gravity)` (was
  `new(mass, restitution, friction, use_gravity)`). These fields were **dead**:
  the contact solver always sourced friction/restitution from the colliders'
  `PhysicsMaterial` (combined per contact), so setting them on the body did
  nothing — the editor inspector even exposed two no-op sliders. Configure
  contact friction/restitution on the collider material instead. Determinism is
  unchanged (proof the fields never affected the simulation). The scripting layer
  followed suit: the Lua `physics.add_rigidbody(id, mass, use_gravity)` binding
  and `ScriptCommand::AddRigidBody` dropped their (ignored) `restitution`/
  `friction` parameters.
- **Graphics stack upgraded** across the Stage B crates: `wgpu 0.20 → 29`,
  `winit 0.29 → 0.30`, `egui 0.28 → 0.34` (plus `egui-wgpu`/`egui-winit` `0.34`,
  `egui_dock 0.13 → 0.19`, `transform-gizmo-egui 0.3 → 0.9`). Public `wgpu`/
  `winit`/`egui` types in the renderer/window/editor/app/facade move to the new
  versions. See [`docs/ENGINE.md`](docs/ENGINE.md) (§6).
- **`bevy_reflect` is now gated behind an off-by-default `reflect` feature** on
  `gizmo-core`, `gizmo-physics-core`, `gizmo-physics-rigid`, and `gizmo-scene`.
  With default features, scene save/load + snapshots fall back to plain `serde`
  (every reflected component also derives `Serialize`/`Deserialize`), and
  `bevy_reflect` no longer appears in the default public API or — after the
  `gizmo-math` dependency-hygiene fix below — in the Stage A dependency tree.
- **`CollisionEvent.contact_points`** is now an opaque `ContactPoints` newtype
  (`gizmo_physics_core::collision::ContactPoints`) instead of leaking
  `arrayvec::ArrayVec`.
- **96+ public enums/structs marked `#[non_exhaustive]`** (error/shape/event
  enums and `Default`/constructor-guaranteed config structs) so future variants
  and fields are not breaking. Closed leaf math/config types are intentionally
  exempt.
- **Many constructors/loaders now return `Result`/`Option`** instead of
  panicking (`spawn_gltf`, `ComponentRegistry::register`, `SceneData::save/load*`,
  `AudioManager::new/play*`, `NetworkClient/Server::new`, `AppWindow::new`,
  `App::run`, renderer `load_*`, …), and 13 concrete error enums were added.
- **Infallible plain-value getters dropped the `get_` prefix** (`get_neighbors →
  neighbors`, `get_entity_component_types → entity_component_types`,
  `get_log_version → log_version`, `get_engine_torque → engine_torque`,
  `get_entity_names → entity_names`). Fallible `get_*` accessors that return
  `Option`/`Result` keep the prefix, following the Bevy convention.
- **MSRV raised to `1.92`** (floor set by `egui 0.34`), up from `1.89`. Enforced
  by a CI `msrv` job. Earlier in the cycle the MSRV was empirically set to `1.89`
  (1.82/1.85 fail on transitive `crypto-common`/`wide`/`safe_arch`).
- **`glam` is now re-exported directly** (`pub use glam::{…}` in `gizmo-math`)
  and documented as an official public dependency, rather than via `bevy_math`.

### Added

- **The engine now runs in the browser (WebGPU/WASM).** `gizmo-renderer`,
  `gizmo-app` and the facade build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with a web
  feature subset, using a reduced 4-bind-group forward pipeline (browser
  `maxBindGroups = 4`; shadows/deferred/compute disabled on wasm). The new
  `demo-web/` crate (wasm-bindgen + `index.html`) shows a live physics scene in
  the browser and was verified end-to-end in headless Chrome. `gizmo-app`'s wasm
  `resumed` implements the async WebGPU init via `spawn_local`; `gizmo-scripting`
  (mlua) is target-gated to native, and the CI `wasm` job now also builds the
  graphics stack. Audio/networking/scripting remain native-only (RELEASING §4g).
- Deterministic same-platform **rollback netcode** (`gizmo-net`, `rollback`
  feature): `PhysicsWorld::snapshot`/`restore_snapshot` (full internal state incl.
  contact warm-start), a `Transport` trait with real-UDP and loopback impls, and
  a GGPO-style `RollbackSession` that converges under lag + packet loss.
- `PhysicsWorld::state_hash()` sync-hash API (process-stable) for desync
  detection and replay, plus a cross-process determinism oracle.
- **TGS Soft constraint solver** (Box2D-v3-style) for stable tall/high-energy
  stacks, with dormant-pair narrow-phase skipping for wide settled scenes.
- Continuous collision detection (CCD) hardening (no tunnelling), full joint
  library behavioural coverage, island-aware sleeping, and a phase-timed
  `PhysicsMetrics` profiler.
- Property-based and differential test suites across ECS, collision, raycast,
  SAT, ABA/multibody, joints, soft-body, and fracture; a CI matrix
  (ubuntu/macos/windows), a ratcheted `clippy -D warnings` gate, and a headless
  determinism gate.
- `docs/ENGINE.md` (§4 staged-1.0 strategy) and this changelog.

### Fixed

- **`gizmo-math` dependency hygiene:** removed an unused regular `bevy_math`
  dependency that transitively pulled `bevy_reflect` into the Stage A *production*
  dependency tree even with the `reflect` feature off. `bevy_reflect` is now
  absent from the default Stage A tree.
- Numerous correctness fixes across the EPA/GJK contact pipeline, integrator
  (body-space inertia), split-impulse leakage, joint effective-mass, renderer
  mesh winding + skin-weight normalisation + skinned-normal inverse-transpose,
  and post-process depth linearisation (see git history for the per-round audit
  detail).
- **egui 0.34 / winit 0.30 deprecations migrated** off the crate-level
  `#![allow(deprecated)]` bridges left by the graphics upgrade: all mechanical
  egui renames, plus the top-level panel `show(ctx)` pattern migrated to egui
  0.34's root-`Ui` composition (`show_inside`). The only remaining (scoped,
  documented) deprecation is winit's closure `EventLoop::run`/`create_window`
  bridge in `gizmo-app`, whose `ApplicationHandler` migration is deferred.

## [0.1.7] — earlier

Initial published series (`0.1.x`) on crates.io: the ECS, math, physics
(rigid/soft/dynamics), renderer, editor/studio, audio, AI, scripting, and
